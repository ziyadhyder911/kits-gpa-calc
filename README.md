# KITSW URR-24 Universal GPA Portal


A simple, regulation-accurate GPA calculator built specifically for students of Kakatiya Institute of Technology & Science, Warangal (KITSW) under the URR-24 regulations.

I built this because most online GPA calculators don’t follow KITSW’s actual credit rules, grade exclusions, or URR-24 logic, which often leads to wrong SGPA/CGPA values.

>Note: This repository contains official URR-24 regulation documents and branch-wise curriculum PDFs for reference and verification.
## Features 

- **Accurate SGPA Calculation:** Follows strict URR-24 guidelines.
- **Target Planner: (Coming Soon)** Helps students calculate the exact SGPA needed in the upcoming semester to achieve a target CGPA.
- **CGPA to Percentage:** Conversion using the official `(CGPA - 0.5) * 10` formula.
- **Universal Branch Support:** Fully populated data for **CSE** and **CSM** (AI & ML). *More branches coming soon/ on request.*

## Technical Stack

- **Frontend:** HTML5, Tailwind CSS
- **Logic:** Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)
- **Design:** Mobile-first, clean UI

## License
