# KITS One

It started with a simple problem: KITSW's credit rules and grade exclusions are unique, and most generic GPA calculators just couldn't get the math right.

What began as a personal tool to calculate my own SGPA accurately gradually evolved into a complete academic companion for every student of **KITSW** under **URR-24** regulations.

KITS One is a complete academic companion designed to take the guesswork out of your journey at college.


## What’s inside?

- **Smart Bunk Buffer:** Track your attendance and know exactly how many classes you can safely skip (or need to attend) to stay above 75%.
- **Accurate SGPA Calculator:** Follows strict URR-24 guidelines. Supports all 9 branches including CSE, CSM, EEE, ECE, ME, and more.
- **Target SGPA Planner:** Input your current standing and your goal, and let the tool tell you exactly what you need to score in your endsem exams.
- **CGPA to % Converter:** One-tap conversion using the official `(CGPA - 0.5) * 10` formula.
- **Dark Mode & Mobile-First:** Because we check our grades late at night and mostly on our phones.



## Technical Stack
